## What?
This is a 3D game written in HTML & CSS. It can run even if you turn off JavaScript in your browser settings.

## Why?
Because I can! And because I wanted to see what was possible without JavaScript. As you can see CSS is not as useless as you would think.

## How?
It uses CSS transforms to create 3D effect, animations to randomize things and radio inputs to save current state. Yeah, that's a lot of hacks!
